\chapter{Introduction}
	The purpose of this document is to explain and demonstrate the major syntax and semantics
	of the language so that users may feel comfortable with the features
	and limitations of FHiCL.

\chapter{Documents}
        Any file with the suffix ".fcl" is considered to be a FHiCL document.
        FHiCL documents are unparsed text files containing syntactical description of a parameter set.
        \par
        FHiCL document closely resemble FHiCL tables in that they are, for the most part,
        containers of \emph{name : value} pairs.
        Unlike tables, however, FHiCL documents do not have braces around their elements
        and documents may contain \emph{prolog} sections.
        \par
        A valid FHiCL document might look something like this:
        \par
        Example 7.1.0:
        \begin{verbatim}
                BEGINPROLOGUE
                   x : 5
                   y : 6
                ENDPROLOGUE
                
                tab1 :
                {
                   a : 1
                   b : 2
                   c : 3
                }
                z : @local::x
                y : @local::y
        \end{verbatim}
        \par
        FHiCL documents, once completed, may be run through any one of a variety of programming lanuage bindings
        in order to produce a parameter set from the FHiCL notation within the document.

\chapter{Comments}
	FHiCL comment notation is a combination of the syntax used in several popular scripting languages and the C/C++ comment syntax.
	FHiCL comments have two notations:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The pound/hash sign ( \# )
		\item Two foreslashes ( // )
	\end{itemize}
	\par
	The former notation is the same notation used in such programming/scripting languages as
	PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby.
	\par
	The latter notation is the C++ inline comment notation.
	\par
	FHiCL comments terminate at end of line. 
	Therefore, it is possible to have a margin comment after a \emph{name : value} pair.
	\section{Examples}
		Below are several examples of valid comment syntax in FHiCL.
		\par
		Example 2.1.0:
		\begin{verbatim}
			#This is a comment
			//This is also a comment
			foo : bar #this is a margin comment
			foo1 : bar2 //and so is this
		\end{verbatim}
\chapter{Associations}
        In most programming languages there is the idea of an \emph{assignment}.
        In FHiCL,  instead of assigning a value to a name,
        we are \emph{associating} a \emph{value} with a \emph{name};
        much like the relationship between a keys and values in a C++ std::map or a Python dictionary.
        \par
        The basic association is the backbone of the FHiCL syntax.
        A basic FHiCL association has three parts:
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item A name
                \item The colon symbol ( : )
                \item A value
        \end{enumerate}
        \par
        Or in EBNF it would look like this:
        \begin{verbatim}
                association => name COLON value
        \end{verbatim}
        \par
        There are slight variations on this model used throughout the language,
        but the basic premise does not change.
        We will see examples of these variations later on.
        \section{Examples}
                Let's say that we want to declare three new FHiCL elements: a, b, c
                and associate with these elements, the values of 1, 2, 3, respectively.
                Here is how that would look in a valid FHiCL document:
                \par
                Example 1.4.0:
                \begin{verbatim}
                        a : 1
                        b : 2
                        c : 3
                \end{verbatim}
                \par
                Now we have three new FHiCL name-value pairs.
                Please note that in \emph{most} aspects of FHiCL,
                the use of whitespace is optional.
                \par
                So this would also be a valid way to write the associations in Example 1.0:
                \par
                Example 1.4.1:
                \begin{verbatim}
                        a:1
                        b:2
                        c:3
                \end{verbatim}
                \par
                Here are a few more examples of valid FHiCL associations using various types of strings:
                \par
                Example 1.4.2:
                \begin{verbatim}
                        dog : "Wish Bone"
                        cat : 'QT McWhiskers'
                        fish : Klaus
                \end{verbatim}
                Please note that unquoted string values must be \emph{simple} in that they may only contain
                the characters A-Z, a-z, or underscores (\_).
                Double-quoted strings may contain special escaped characters,
                and single-quoted strings are quoted verbatim.

\chapter{Names}
	FHiCL names are simple sequences of characters.
	Names must begin with an alphabetic character,
	or with an underscore.
	\par
	Illustrated in Example 1.1.0,
	you will find a list of examples of valid FHiCL name values.
	\par
	Example 1.1.0:
	\begin{verbatim}
		a
		name
		the_dog
		_a_cat
		a_fish_
		_a_bird_
	\end{verbatim}
\chapter{Values}
	FHiCL values can be extremely diverse.
	FHiCL values are any one of the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Atom
		\item Table
		\item Sequence
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Atoms}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Literal
			\item Number
			\item String
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Literal}
			FHiCL literals consist of the two boolean values,
			\emph{true} and \emph{false},
			as well as \emph{nil},
			which is the FHiCL implementation of \emph{null}
		\subsection{Number}
			FHiCL numbers are made up of one of the following:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Signed or unsigned integers.
				\item Signed or unsigned infinity.
				\item Real numbers.
			\end{itemize}
			\par
			Leading zeros are allowed in FHiCL numbers, 
			however please note that any leading zeros will be stripped in the resulting parameter set.
		\subsection{String}
	        	\par
        		Single-quoted strings are taken verbatim
        		and may contain escaped or printable characters as well as whitespace.
        		\par
        		Double-quoted strings may contain escaped and printable characters,
        		but are \emph{not} quoted verbatim.
        		Escaped characters are processed in the string.
        		Double-quoted strings may contain whitespace.
       			\par
        		In Example 1.2.0, there are a few examples of valid FHiCL values.
        		Example 1.2.0:
        		\begin{verbatim}
                		a
                		ab
                		string
                		"string"
                		'string'
                		'string\n'
                		12345
                		"123abc"
                		'123abc'
        		\end{verbatim}

	\section{Tables}
                A FHiCL table is a container for name-value pairs
                and is denoted by (possibly empty) braces.
                \par
                Example 3.1.0
                \begin{verbatim}
                        {
                           a : 5
                           b : 6
                           c : 7
                        }
                \end{verbatim}
                \par
                Elements of a FHiCL table may \emph{not} be comma-separated.
                The elements may be separated by either whitespace or newline.
                Therefore it would also be valid to write \emph{table1} like this:
                \par
                Example 3.1.1
                \begin{verbatim}
                        { a : 5 b : 6 c : 7 }
                        OR
                        { a:5 b:6 c:7 }
                        OR
                        {
                           a:5
                           b:6
                           c:7
                        }
                        NOT
                        { a:5, b:6, c:7}
                \end{verbatim}
                \par
                FHiCL tables also have a unique quality in that they may contain comments.
                This is true only if the elements of the table are line-separated.
                Example 3.1.2
                \begin{verbatim}
                        {
                           a : 5
                           #This is a comment
                           b : 6
                           //This is a comment
                        }
                        NOT

                        { a:5 #this is a comment b:6}
                \end{verbatim}
                \par
                The second case is invalid since FHiCL comments terminate at end of line.
                This results in the closing brace for the table being interpreted as part of the comment.

        \section{Sequences}
                A FHiCL sequence is a container of values
                and is denoted by (possibly empty) brackets.
                \par
                Example 3.2.0:
                \begin{verbatim}
                        [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
                        
                        OR

                        [
                           1,
                           2,
                           3,
                           4
                        ]
                \end{verbatim}
                \par
                Elements of a sequence \emph{must} be separated by commas.
                Each element in a sequence is a value, and so,
                it is possible to have a sequence of tables such as:
                \begin{verbatim}
                   seq:[ { a:1 b:2 }, { c:3 d:4 } ]
                \end{verbatim}
                \par
                Also, please note that FHiCL sequences may not contain name-value pairs.
                \par
                FHiCL sequences may not contain comments.
\chapter{Hierarchical Names}
        \par
        There is also an advanced type of FHiCL name called
        \emph{hierarchical name} or \emph{hname}, for short.
        These hnames are compound names linked together through the use of
        a \emph{dot index} or a \emph{bracket index}.
        Hnames are used to access members of FHiCL containers
        and their associated values.
	\section{Dot Index}
		A \emph{dot index} is the operator \emph{"."} used to denote access to the elements of a FHiCL table.
		For instance, assume that we have the following table:
		\par
		\begin{verbatim}
			tab1:{ a:5 b:6 }
		\end{verbatim}
		In order to access either \emph{a} or \emph{b} in \emph{tab1},
		the use of the \emph{dot index} is required, as such:
		\begin{verbatim}
			tab1.a
			tab1.b
		\end{verbatim}
		The result of each statement will be the \emph{value} associated with each \emph{name} in the table \emph{tab1}.
	\section{Bracket Index}
		A \emph{bracket index} is the operator \emph{"[ ]"} used to denote access to the elements of a FHiCL sequence.
		For example, take the folowing FHiCL sequence:
		\par
		\begin{verbatim}
			seq1:[ 1, 2, 3 ]
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		In order to access any of the three elements in \emph{seq1},
		the use of the \emph{bracket index} is required, like so:
		\begin{verbatim}
			seq1[0]
			seq1[1]
			seq1[2]	
		\end{verbatim}
		The integer in between the brackets is the \emph{index} of the element being accessed.

\chapter{Overrides}
	In FHiCL, the term \emph{override} has special meaning and its use is two-fold:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Reassociation of an existing name to a new value.
		\item Creation of a new element within a table or sequence.
	\end{enumerate}
	\par
	The syntax for a FHiCL override statement is identical to that of a FHiCL association.
	The only difference between the two is that in an override statement,
	the \emph{name} portion of the statement must be the name of a pre-existing element
	which exists at the same level of scope as the override statement.
	\par
	Please note that the use of an \emph{hname} allows an override statement to descend through layers of scope,
	but there is no way to ascend through layers of scope.
	\par
	Example 2.0.0:
	\begin{verbatim}
		x : 5
		x : 6
	\end{verbatim}
	\par
	Example 2.0.1
	\begin{verbatim}
		tab1: { a:1 b:2 }
		tab1.c : 3
	\end{verbatim}
\chapter{Include Statements}
	In order to import values from one FHiCL document into another,
	use of the FHiCL include statement is necessary.
	The behavior of this include statement is similar,
	and yet still different from the C/C++ include statement from which it was borrowed.
	\par
	The syntax for a FHiCL include statement begins with a pound or hash symbol (\#),
	followed by the unquoted string "include".
	The include is followed by \emph{exactly one white space}
	and then a quoted string containing the full name of the target FHiCL document.
	\par
	Example 4.1.0:
	\begin{verbatim}
		#include "filename.fcl"
	\end{verbatim}	
	\par
	Since the include statement shares a common starting character with that of one of the FHiCL comment notations,
	if the syntax of the include statement is incorrect,
	a FHiCL parser will treat the faulty include statement as a comment.
	\par
	If the file name within the quotes is invalid, however, the include statement will \emph{not} be treated as a comment.

\chapter{References}
        If at any point it becomes necessary to associate a name with a value of an existing name-value pair, or to
        assign an existing value as a member of a sequence,
        the use of the FHiCL \emph{Reference} notation is needed.
        \par
        There are two versions of the reference notation in FHiCL, one being a local reference,
        the other being a call or fetch to a predetermined database:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item @local::
                \item @db::
        \end{itemize}
        \par
        References may appear wherever a value normally is expected.
        The only prerequesite being that the name used within the reference notation must be the name of an existing element
        either within the current FHiCL document
        or within the database.
        \par
        Example 5.1.0:
        \begin{verbatim}
                x : 5
                y : @local::x
                z : @db::t
        \end{verbatim}
        \par
        In this example, the value of \emph{y} is a reference to the pre-existing name-value pair \emph{x : 5}.
        The element named \emph{z}'s value is a reference to a name-value pair with name \emph{t}
        which is to be found in a database.
        \par
        The names used within a FHiCL reference notation must be extremely specific in order to reference the correct element.
        \par
        Example 5.1.0:
        \begin{verbatim}
                x : 5
                y : @local::x
                z : @db::t
        \end{verbatim}
        \par
        In this example, the value of \emph{y} is a reference to the pre-existing name-value pair \emph{x : 5}.
        The element named \emph{z}'s value is a reference to a name-value pair with name \emph{t}
        which is to be found in a database.
        \par
        The names used within a FHiCL reference notation must be extremely specific in order to reference the correct element.
        \par
        Example 5.1.1:
        \begin{verbatim}
                x : 5
                x : 6
                tab1 :
                {
                   x : 1
                   y : 2
                   z : 3
                }
                y : @local::x
        \end{verbatim}
        \par
        In Example 5.1.1, we start with a definition \emph{ x : 5 },
        and then we override the value of \emph{x} with the number 6.
        The value of \emph{y} in this case will be a reference to the
        most recently encountered instance of \emph{x} within the same scope
        as \emph{y}.
        \par
        Essentially this means that the reference to \emph{x} here will have the value
        of \emph{ x : 6 }.

\chapter{Prologs}
        FHiCL documents may contain \emph{prolog} sections,
	which contain declarations used to create a standard configuration for a FHiCL document.
        \par
        The beginning of a \emph{prolog} section is denoted by:
        \emph{BEGINPROLOGUE}
        and the end is denoted by:
        \emph{ENDPROLOGUE}.
        \par
        Example 6.1.0:
        \begin{verbatim}
                BEGINPROLOGUE
                   x : 5
                   y : 6
                ENDPROLOGUE
        \end{verbatim}
        All elements declared between the beginning and the end
        do not exist within the parameter set unless specifically
        \emph{referenced} within the document.
        \par
        Elements within a prologue section may be referenced,
        but may not be modified in any way otherwise.
        For instance, take the prologue section from Example 5.1.0.
        \par
        We can reference both \emph{x} and \emph{y} in the prologue section by using the reference notation:
        \par
        Example 6.1.1:
        \begin{verbatim}
                z : @local::x
                u : @local::y
        \end{verbatim}
        \par
        However we cannot modify x or y in any way.
        Access to values within a prolog works exactly like it does when the referenced value is in the document.
        You use the reference notation \emph{@local::} folowed by the target value you wish to reference.
        \par
        It is important to note that you \emph{MAY NOT} override values within a prolog from outside of a prolog.
        The only way to override prolog values is to use a reference within either the same prolog, or another prolog.
        Statements that appear to be attempting to override prolog values are treated as new associations, therefore creating
        new associations in the parameter set.

\chapter{Conclusion}
	This concludes the FHiCL Quick Start document. 
	The definitions and examples given above will allow users to create their own FHiCL documents with ease,
	and should provide a quick reference for users who are familiar with the language but are in need of a primer.
