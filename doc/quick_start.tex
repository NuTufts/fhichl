\section{Introduction}
	The purpose of this document is to train users in the proper useage
	of the Fermilab Hierarchical Configuration Language (FHiCL).
	This Quick Start Guide will explain and demonstrate the major syntax and semantics
	of the language so that users may create valid FHiCL documents with ease.
\section{Comments}
	FHiCL comment notation bears similarity to that of PHP
	with the exception of FHiCL not supporting the C/C++ block comment notation.
	FHiCL comments have two notations:
	\being{itemize}
		\item The pound/hash sign ( \# )
		\item Two backslashes ( \testbackslash\testbackslash )
	\end{itemize}
	\par
	The former notation is the same notation used in such programming and scripting languages as
	Perl, Python, and Ruby.
	\par
	The latter notation is the C++ inline comment notation.
	\par
\section{Associations}
        \subsection{Names}
		FHiCL names are simple, non-quoted strings.
		Names may not begin with a digit,
		but may begin with an underscore.
		\par
		Illustrated in Example 1.1.0,
		you will find a list of examples of valid FHiCL name values.
		\par
		Example 1.1.0:
		\begin{verbatim}
			a
			name
			the_dog
			_a_cat
			a_fish_
			_a_bird_
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		There is also an advanced type of FHiCL name called 
		\emph{hierarchical name} or \emph{hname} for short.
		These hnames are compound names linked together through the use of
		a \emph{dot index} or a \emph{bracket index}.
		Hnames are used to access members of FHiCL containers
		and their associated values.
		\par
		Example 1.1.1:
		\begin{verbatim}
			name.first = "beth"
			name.last = "johnson"
			scores[0] = 5
			scores[3] = 6
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		We will see more in-depth examples of hname useage later on.
	\subsection{Values}
		In contrast, FHiCL values are extremely diverse.
		FHiCL values can be any one of the following:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Single character (quoted or unquoted)
			\item String (quoted or unquoted)
			\item Number
			\item Table
			\item Sequence
			\item Document
			\item 
		\end{itemize}
		\par
		In Example 1.2.0, there are a few examples of valid FHiCL values.
		Example 1.2.0:
		\begin{verbatim}
			a
			ab
			string
			"string"
			'string'
			12345
			"123abc"
			'123abc'
		\end{verbatim}
	\subsection{The Syntax}
		In most programming languages there is the idea of an \emph{assignment}. 
		In FHiCL, however, instead of assigning a value to a name, 
		we are \emph{associating} a value with a name; 
		much like the relationship between a key and a value in a C++ std::map.
		\par
		The basic association is the backbone of the FHiCL syntax.
		A basic FHiCL association has three parts:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item A name followed by...
			\item The colon symbol ( : ); followed by...
			\item A value.
		\end{enumerate}
		\par
		Or in EBNF it would look like this:
		\begin{verbatim}
			association => name COLON value
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		There are slight variations on this model used throughout the language,
		but the basic premise does not change. 
		We will see examples of these variations later on.
	\subsection{Examples}
		Let's say that we want to declare three new FHiCL elements: a, b, c
		with values of 1, 2, 3, respectively. 
		Here is how that would look in a valid FHiCL document:
		\par
		Example 1.4.0:
		\begin{verbatim}
			a : 1
			b : 2
			c : 3
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		Now we have three new FHiCL name-value pairs!
		Please note that in \emph{most} aspects of FHiCL,
		the use of whitespace is optional.
		\par
		So this would also be a valid way to write the associations in Example 1.0:
		\par
		Example 1.4.1:
		\begin{verbatim}
			a:1
			b:2
			c:3
		\end{verbatim} 
 		\par
		Here are a few more examples of valid FHiCL associations using various types of strings:
		\par
		Example 1.4.2:
		\begin{verbatim}
			dog : "Wish Bone"
			cat : 'QT McWhiskers'
			fish : Klaus
		\end{verbatim}
		Please note that unquoted string values must be \emph{simple} in that they may not contain
		any white space.
		Double-quoted strings may contain special escaped characters,
		and single-quoted strings are quoted verbatim.
\section{Overrides}
	In FHiCL, the term \emph{override} has special meaning and its use is two-fold:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Reassociation of an existing name to a new value.
		\item Creation of a new element within a table or sequence.
	\end{enumerate}
	\par
	The syntax for a FHiCL override statement is identical to that of a FHiCL association.
	The only difference between the two is that in an override statement,
	the \emph{name} portion of the statement must be the name of a pre-existing element
	which exists at the same level of scope as the override statement.
	\par
	Please note that the use of an hname allows an override statement to descend through layers of scope,
	but there is no way to ascend through layers of scope.
	\par
	Example 2.0.0:
	\begin{verbatim}
		x : 5
		x : 6
	\end{verbatim}
\section{Tables And Sequences}
	Two major constructs in FHiCL are the \emph{table} and the \emph{sequence}.
	Each of these containters has a unique syntax for declaration and access.

	\subsection{Tables}
		A FHiCL table is a container for name-value pairs
		and is denoted by (possibly empty) braces.
		\par
		Example 3.1.0
		\begin{verbatim}
			table1 :
			{
			   a : 5
			   b : 6
			   c : 7
			}
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		Elements of a FHiCL table may \emph{not} be comma-separated.
		The elements may be separated by either whitespace or newline.
		Therefore it would also be valid to write \emph{table1} like this:
		\par
		Example 3.1.1
		\begin{verbatim}
			table1 :{ a : 5 b : 6 c : 7 }
			OR
			table1 :{ a:5 b:6 c:7 }
			NOT
			table1 :{ a:5, b:6, c:7}
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		FHiCL tables also have a unique quality in that they may contain comments.
		This is true only if the elements of the table are line-separated.
		Example 3.1.2
		\begin{verbatim}
			table1 :
			{
			   a : 5
			   #This is a comment
			   b : 6
			   //This is a comment
			}

			NOT

			table1 :{ a:5 #this is a comment b:6}
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		The second case is invalid since FHiCL comments take the rest of the line,
		the closing brace for the table will be interpreted as part of the comment.
		\par
		In order to acces members of a FHiCL table, use of an \emph{hname}
		with the \emph{dot index} is needed.
		For instance, if we wanted to access \emph{a} from \emph{table1} in Example 3.1.0,
		and override the value of \emph{a} to 4, it would look like this:
		\par
		Example 3.1.3:
		\begin{verbatim}
			table1.a : 4
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		Similarly, if we wanted to add or \emph{override} in a fourth member to \emph{table1}
		(we'll call it \emph{d} and we'll give it a value of 8)
		it would look like this:
		\par
		Example 3.1.4:
		\begin{verbatim}
			table1.d : 8
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
	\subsection{Sequences}
		A FHiCL sequence is a container of values
		and is denoted by (possibly empty) brackets.
		\par
		Example 3.2.0:
		\begin{verbatim}
			seq1:[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
			
			OR

			seq1:
			[
			   1,
			   2,
			   3,
			   4
			]
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		Elements of a sequence \emph{must} be separated by commas.
		Also, please note that FHiCL sequences may not contain name-value pairs.
		\par
		FHiCL sequences may not contain comments.
		\par
		In order to access members of a FHiCL sequence, use of an \emph{hname}
		with the \emph{bracket index} is needed.
		For example, if we wanted to access the first element in seq1 from Example 3.2.0,
		and override the value to 5, it would look like this:
		\par
		Example 3.2.1:
		\begin{verbatim}
			seq1[0] : 5
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		Similarly if we wanted to add a fifth value (let's say, the number 6?) to seq1,
		here's how it would look:
		\par
		Example 3.2.2:
		\begin{verbatim}
			seq1[4] : 6
		\end{verbatim}
		\par
		Please note that indices of FHiCL sequences begin at zero, not one.
