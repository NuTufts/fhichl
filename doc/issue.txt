String Canonical Form Issue - FHiCL

Consider two FHiCL documents:

x : .5

AND 

x : 0.5

Do we consider the two parameter sets arising from these two documents to be equal?

YES -> If you want to treat the two parameter sets as different, but pass an equality check,
there will be an issue of storage and canonical representation.



Currently, if a number can be canonically represented as an integer for string output, it will be.
Otherwise, the number will be represented in scientific notation.

QUESTION: If the numeric values do not change, is it acceptable that the canonical string form may appear in a parameter set differently
from what the user typed into the FHiCL document?

YES -> No issue

NO -> Issue with comparison of equality. Secondary Question: What does equality mean?

Answer (pt. 2) -> Two identical parameter sets will produce identical results when used in a module.
