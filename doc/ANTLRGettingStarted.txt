Getting ANTLR to compile:
  This is assuming ANTLR is installed properly (with the .jar and the C++ runtime)
  Find ExternalAntlr4Cpp.cmake and move it to the source directory in a folder called cmake.
  With your cmake files, add the snippet from ExternalAntlr4Cpp.cmake to your main CMakeLists.txt
  This should link the cmake macro that generates the ANTLR4 files. 
  
Test FHiCL files
  In tests/fcl are two files, file.fcl and extra.fcl
  Move these into the same directory as the generated binary and execute passing file.fcl
